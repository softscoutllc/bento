## FAQ

### Do I need a license key to use SoftScout PDF?

No. SoftScout PDF does not use license keys. The commercial license grants you legal rights to use the software in proprietary applications.

### Can I use SoftScout PDF in my SaaS product?

Yes, with a commercial license. Without it, you must comply with AGPL-3.0, which requires you to make your full source code available to users.

### What about the AGPL components?

Components like CPDF are licensed under AGPL v3 and remain under that license. The commercial license covers SoftScout PDF's own code but does not override third-party AGPL obligations.

### How do I get an invoice?

Email [contact@softscout.net](mailto:contact@softscout.net) with your Ko-fi purchase confirmation, and we'll send an official invoice.
